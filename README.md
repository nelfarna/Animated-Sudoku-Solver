## Animated Sudoku Solver

This Javascript / HTML 5 Canvas application first generates a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle of various levels of difficulty. It then performs an animation on Canvas to help visualize a solution being built using brute force and backtracking. 

The program first solves the puzzle and saves all randomly generated cell values (that potentially meet Sudoku rules) in an array as it moves forward and backtracks. This array is then used to produce the animation that demonstrates the backtracking process, with a time delay between each digit display to allow the user to follow.
